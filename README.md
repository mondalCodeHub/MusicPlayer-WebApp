## About 
 This is a basic music player web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can listen to their favourite songs here. A user can also use other features such as shifting to the next song or going back to the previous song.

# Future Update
This web app contains a few hardcoded features. Everything will be fixed as soon as possible.
